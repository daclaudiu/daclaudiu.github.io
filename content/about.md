## Summary

Hey there! I'm a tech and finance enthusiast who's always up for a good challenge. I love exploring cutting-edge topics like automation, privacy and security, and personal finance. I love movies, books, dogs and music.

## Education

Bachelor of Business and Administration in Marketing from University of Bucharest, 2018-2021.

## Books I love:

I read mostly non-fiction books as I feel like the knowledge they provide can be easily acessible and its faster to digest.

4. "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" by Yuval Noah Harari 
5. "Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty" by Patrick Radden Keefe (not finished yet but it's very good so far)
