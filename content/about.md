## Summary

Greetings! As an avid learner with a diverse set of passions, I'm always seeking out new experiences to enrich my understanding of the world. 

I'm passionate about finance and technology, constantly exploring new tools and techniques to improve my work life. 

My personal interests include: books, video games, racing, music and movies.

## Books I love:

I read mostly non-fiction books as I feel like the knowledge they provide can be easily acessible and its faster to digest. 

Here are my top 5 books I've read so far and would recommend to anyone.

1. "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman
2. "The 48 Laws of Power" by Robert Greene
3. "The Psychology of Persuasion" by Robert Cialdini 
4. "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" by Yuval Noah Harari 
5. "Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty" by Patrick Radden Keefe (not finished yet but it's very good so far)

## Movies I love:

It's very hard to mention the top 5 movies but so far I would always recommend these 5 ones to anyone.

1. Pulp Fiction
2. GoodFellas
3. The Dark Knight 
4. Inception
